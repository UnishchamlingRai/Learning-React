CHAT GPT EXPLANATION
Certainly! Let's break down the complex concepts into simpler terms:

1. **Rendering Phase Recap:**
   - **Purpose:** The goal is to figure out what needs to change in the user interface (UI).
   - **Steps:**
     - Call functions of components that need an update.
     - Create updated React elements.
     - Form a new "virtual DOM," which is like a plan for the UI changes.

2. **Reconciliation:**
   - **Why:** To avoid rebuilding the entire UI, React compares the new virtual DOM with the current UI state.
   - **How:**
     - Use a special tool called the "Fiber reconciler."
     - Work with a tree structure called the "fiber tree."

3. **Fiber Tree:**
   - **Use:** Represents the UI elements in a tree structure.
   - **Role:** Helps efficiently update only the parts of the UI that need changes.

4. **Commit Phase:**
   - **Objective:** Apply the planned changes to the actual UI (DOM).
   - **Process:**
     - Go through the list of changes generated during rendering.
     - Update, insert, or delete DOM elements.
     - Ensure this process is uninterrupted for a consistent UI.

5. **React DOM Library:**
   - **Role:** Performs the actual DOM changes during the commit phase.
   - **Separation:** React itself doesn't directly touch the DOM; it focuses on rendering.
   - **Importance:** Allows React to be used with different platforms (web, mobile, etc.).

6. **Hosts and Renderers:**
   - **Hosts:** Platforms where React apps can be shown (e.g., web browsers, mobile devices).
   - **Renderers:** Different packages for outputting results to specific hosts.
   - **Example:** React DOM for web, React Native for mobile.

7. **Recap:**
   - **Trigger:** Start with an initial render or a state update.
   - **Render Phase:** Call component functions, create a virtual DOM.
   - **Reconciliation:** Compare virtual DOM with the current state (fiber tree).
   - **Commit Phase:** Apply changes to the actual DOM using React DOM.
   - **Result:** Browser repaints, and the user sees an updated UI.

Remember, this process allows React to be versatile, working not only for web applications but also for various platforms using different renderers. The separation of render and commit phases contributes to efficient and consistent UI updates.

Welcome back to part three of How Rendering Works Behind the Scenes. So we just finished learning about the render phase which resulted in a list of DOM updates, and this list will now get used in the commit phase.

Now, technically speaking, the current work in progress fiber tree also goes into this commit phase, but let's keep it simple here. So these are more conceptual diagrams so that we can understand what is happening, not a 100% accurate description of the algorithms inside React, all right?

But anyway, as you know by now, the commit phase is where React finally writes to the DOM, so it inserts, deletes and updates DOM elements. You'll sometimes also read that React flushes updates to the DOM in this phase. So basically, React goes through the effects list that was created during rendering and applies them one by one to the actual DOM elements that were in the already existing DOM tree.

Now riding to the DOM happens all in one go. So we say that the commit phase is synchronous unlike the rendering phase, which can be paused. So committing cannot be interrupted. Now this is necessary so that the DOM never shows partial results which ensures that the UI always stays consistent. In fact, that's the whole point of dividing the entire process into the render phase and the commit phase in the first place. It's so that rendering can be paused, resumed, and discarded, and the results of all that rendering can then be flushed to the DOM in one go.

Then once the commit phase is completed, the work in progress fiber tree becomes the current tree for the next render cycle. That's because, remember, fiber trees are never discarded and never recreated from scratch. Instead, they are reused in order to save precious rendering time.

And with that, we close up the commit phase. The browser will then notice that the DOM has been changed, and as a result, it will repaint the screen whenever it has some idle time. So this is where these DOM updates are finally made visible to the user in the form of an updated user interface.

Now, I'm not gonna go into how this phase works because this is really more about how browsers work internally, and not React. However, there's still one more thing that we need to talk about.

So the browser paint face that we just mentioned is, of course, performed by whatever browser the user is using. And the render phase is obviously performed by the React Library. But what about the commit phase? We would think that it's also done by React, right? But actually that's not true. It's actually a separate library that writes to the DOM, and it's called React DOM. So not very creative, but that's just what it's called.

So in fact, React itself does never touch the DOM, and it actually has no idea where the result of the render phase will actually be committed and painted. So React only does the render phase but not the commit phase. And the reason for that is that React itself was designed to be used independently from the platform where elements will actually be shown, and therefore React can be used with many different so-called hosts.

Now up until this point, we have only ever thought of React in conjunction with a DOM because we usually use it to build web applications. And in 90% of the cases, that's actually what we do with React. But the truth is that React is used with other hosts as well. For example, we can actually build native mobile applications for iOS and Android using React Native, or we can build videos with React using a package called Remotion. And we can even create all kinds of documents like Word or PDF documents, Figma designs, and many more, using different so-called renderers.

Now, if we think about this, Renderer is actually a pretty terrible name because according to React's own terminology, Renderers do not render, but they commit the results of the render phase. But I think that this Renderer name comes from a time before React divided the render and the commit phase into two separate phases. And so they chose this term of Renderer because it fits with the common sense definition of rendering.

But anyway, in all these situations, the results of the render phase is not really a list of DOM updates, but a list of updates of whatever elements are used in the host that's being used. So the term virtual DOM, then, also doesn't really make much sense when we look at it from this angle, which is just one more reason why the React team prefers the more accurate name of React Elementary.

Now, all these details are, of course, not really that important. What I want you to retain from this slide is that the React Library is not the one responsible for writing to the DOM because the DOM is just one of many hosts to which React apps can be committed, so to which they can be output, basically. And for each of these hosts, we have a different package that we can use. And that's why in our index.js file, we always import both React and React DOM, right? And so now you know the exact reason why we have to do that.

All right, so after looking at all these phases in so much detail, let's do a quick recap here and summarize everything that we have learned. So the whole process of rendering and displaying a React application on the screen starts with a trigger, which can either be the initial render of the app or a state update in one of the component instances.

This then triggers the render phase which does not produce any visual output. So this phase starts by rendering all component instances that need a re-render. And rendering in React simply means to call the components functions. This will create one or more updated React elements which will be placed in a new virtual DOM, which is actually simply a tree of React elements.

Now, what's really important to remember about this process is that rendering a component will cause all of its child components to be rendered as well, no matter if props changed or not. This is because React doesn't know whether children have been affected by the parent re-rendering or not.

Now, next up, this new virtual DOM needs to be reconciled with the current fiber tree. So with the representation of the elementary before the state update. This is necessary because it would be slow and inefficient to destroy and rebuild the entire DOM tree each time that something on the screen must be updated. Instead, reconciliation tries to reuse as much of the DOM as possible by finding the smallest number of DOM updates that reflect the latest state update on the screen.

Now this reconciliation process is done using a reconciler called Fiber, which works with immutable data structure called the fiber tree. And in this tree, for each React element and DOM
