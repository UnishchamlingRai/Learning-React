Hi Unish mugi,

I'm Nelson, a high school student with a burning passion for technology. I've been consistently learning various aspects of tech on my own, but I'm facing some limitations due to the lack of tech exposure in my country. Your extensive experience in this field is truly impressive.

Could you spare some time to provide advice and mentorship? I'm eager to learn and break into the tech world. Your insights would be invaluable.

Best regards,
Nelson
