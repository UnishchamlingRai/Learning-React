//CHATGPT EXPLAINATION
Sure, let's break it down in simpler terms:

Imagine you're building a house with different rooms, and each room has its own things (state). Now, there are different types of things you can have in your rooms, and we need a way to organize and manage them.

1. **Local State**: Some things (state) are only needed in one room. We call this "local state." It's like having a TV remote that only works in your living room. We use tools like useState or useReducer to manage these things.

2. **Global State**: Sometimes, you want things to be available in many rooms. We call this "global state." It's like having a rule for the entire house. We can either put these things in a special parent room or use a tool called "context" to share them with all rooms.

3. **Remote State**: Some things come from outside, like ordering food. If it's only needed in one room, it's still local. If it needs to be shared, it becomes global. We can still use local state tools for these.

4. **Complex Global State**: If you have many things that need to be shared everywhere, like a big family rule, you might need a special tool (library) to manage it efficiently. There are different tools like Redux, React Query, etc.

5. **URL**: Think of the website address (URL) as a note that tells the house what to show. You can put some special information there so that if you share the URL, others see the same things you see.

6. **Browser Storage**: Sometimes, you want to keep things even if you leave the house and come back later. It's like leaving a note for yourself. We use tools like local storage or session storage for this.

Now, there's a chart to help you decide where to put your things:

- **Local UI State**: Things needed in one room - use local state tools.
- **Global UI State**: Things for the entire house - use a parent room or context.
- **Local Remote State**: Things from outside needed in one room - use local state tools.
- **Global Remote State**: Many things from outside needed everywhere - use a library, context, or URL.
  
Remember, you don't have to memorize this chart. It's like a guide. As you build more things (apps), you'll get a feeling for where to put your stuff! If you want your things to stay even when you leave and come back, you can use browser storage. 

Hope this helps! Feel free to ask if you have more questions.






///SUBTITLE
Certainly! Here's the text without numbers:

"So now that we know how the Context API works, it's time to get back to talking about state management in general and how the Context API fits into the state management tools that we already had before.

Now we already talked about state management earlier in the course, but it was more of an introduction. So back then, I told you that state management is basically just like giving each piece of state the right home, right?

In that lecture, we talked about when to use state, local versus global state, and I also gave you this handy flowchart to decide when and where to create state, which of course you can keep using.

Now in this lecture, we will talk about UI versus remote state. I will show you all the options for where to place state and also all the state management tools that are available to us to manage all these different types of state.

Let's actually start with these different types of state that can exist in all web applications. So, we can classify state in terms of state accessibility and in terms of state domain.

When it comes to state accessibility, state can be either a local state or global state. Local state is only needed by one or a few components, while global state might be needed by many components in different positions of the tree. That's why local state is only accessible inside the component that it was defined in, plus maybe its child components, while global state can actually be made accessible to every single component in the application.

If you need to create a new state variable in a component but are not sure whether it should be local or global state, there is a very nice trick that can help. All you need to do is to ask yourself if this component was rendered twice, should a state update in one of the components reflect in the other one? And if the answer is no, then it means that it's local state. But if the answer is yes, you have found yourself a global state variable. So just keep this trick in mind for the future as it can be quite helpful.

Now, moving on to the state domain, we can classify each piece of state as either remote state or UI state. Remote state is basically all application data that is loaded from a remote server, usually using an API. It's state that lives on a server but that can be loaded into our application. UI state, on the other hand, is basically everything else – things like the currently selected theme, applied list filters, form inputs, open panels, and many, many more. Again, all state that is not the core application data that we usually fetch from an API is UI state.

So whenever you have some state, it's extremely important to always know whether you're dealing with remote state or with UI state because they need to be managed in a completely different way. Remote state is fundamentally different from UI state because we usually get it in an asynchronous way and because the data might need to be re-fetched and updated frequently. Therefore, in a large scale application, remote state should be cached, revalidated, and so on. And for that, we need some specialized tools.

UI state, on the other hand, is usually synchronous and stored right in the application and does not interact with any server at all. This means that UI state is very easy to handle with the tools that we already know of, things like useState or useReducer. And we will take a closer look at these tools later in this lecture.

For now, let's focus on where we can actually physically place each state variable in our code base. Whenever we need a new piece of state, we have about six different options on where we can place it. If all we need is local state, then we simply place it in a local component using useState, useReducer, or even useRef. A ref can also be considered state even though it won't re-render the component.

Many times, we actually need a piece of state in multiple related components. And so then, it's time to lift the state up by placing it in a parent component of all the components that need it. So, a parent component is another state placement option.

However, even that sometimes is not enough. Sometimes we have actual global state, and then one good solution is to place the state into a context. This is where the Context API that we have been learning about comes into play, as we can use it together with useState or useReducer to manage global state. Just note that context on its own is not who is managing the state. State still needs to be created and updated by useState or by useReducer. But we then use the Context API to give all components in the tree access to that state.

The Context API is actually best suited to manage UI state and not necessarily remote state, especially when you are building a bigger application. But more about that in the next slide.

If you need to manage remote state in a complex application or just need a more efficient way of managing global state in general, you can opt for one of the many third-party state management libraries that exist in the React ecosystem. You can place your global state into Redux, into React Query, SWR, Zustand, or one of the many other external state management solutions. Some of these solutions are suited for global remote state, and some for global UI state or both.

Next up, as we learned in the previous section, is the URL. The URL is yet another excellent place where we can store global state that we want to make easily shareable and bookmarkable, or that we just want to pass between pages.

Finally, sometimes we need to store some data inside the user's browser. In that case, we can use local storage, session storage, or something like that. Just like refs, this is state that won't actually re-render any components but it's still technically application state, which is why I included this in this list as yet another possible state location.

All right, so hopefully, this is a helpful overview for you that you can keep handy once you start building your own applications. And now to finish, let's try to answer the question of how to manage the different types of state in practice? Or in other words, what tools should be used for each kind of state?

If we combine all classifications of state according to

 accessibility and domain, we get this little chart here. Now you don't need to memorize this chart at all. It's more like a tool to help you decide what state management tools to use. And as you can see, we have the six state placement options that we just talked about: local component state, parent component state, context, third-party library, URL, and browser storage.

And on the vertical axis, we have state accessibility – either local or global – and on the horizontal axis, we have state domain – either UI state or remote state. And now based on this classification, you can decide which state management tools make sense for your specific use case.

All right, let's go through this chart and decide what tools to use for each type of state. Starting with local UI state, we can use local component state, and that makes total sense because it's local state that only affects the UI.

Next, we have global UI state. And for that, we can use either a parent component or context. And the choice between these two depends on the component structure and on whether we need to skip some components in the middle. If we do, we use context; otherwise, we use a parent component.

Moving on, we have local remote state. And for that, we can use local component state again. Even though the data might come from a remote server, the state itself is still just local UI state because it doesn't need to be shared globally.

And then we have global remote state. And for that, we can use either a third-party library, context, or URL. Again, the choice between these three depends on the specific use case and on the complexity of the application. Generally speaking, if the global remote state is fairly simple, context might be enough. If it's more complex or if you have a very big application, a third-party library might be a better choice.

Now local state is always managed by useState or useReducer, regardless of whether it's UI or remote state. And global state is always managed by useState, useReducer, or a third-party library.

Finally, if we need to persist the state, like local remote state or global remote state, we might also need to use browser storage.

All right, so this was a quick guide on how to decide what tools to use for managing state in React. Again, you don't need to memorize this chart. It's just there as a reference. And as you gain more experience in building applications, you will automatically develop a feeling for which tools to use for which types of state."
