#Day39ofClg_askmitra #Clg_askmitra60days
Hello, this is Unish Rai. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 60-days challenge and Today is my 39th day. I encourage everyone to begin their 60 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. Iâ€™m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com 

Today's Learnings:
Today I finished making this full-stack project. The tech stack used to build this project includes React for the frontend, React Context for UI state management, React Query for remote state management, Recharts for creating beautiful charts, Styled Components for styling, React Hook Form for forms, and Supabase for the backend.
