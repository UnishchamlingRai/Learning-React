Okay, so you've probably heard about the "useEffect" hook in React. It's like a tool that helps your components do extra things, like fetching data or updating something on the screen. But there's this cool part called the "dependency array" that we need to understand.

Imagine you have this friend, "useEffect," and it likes to do its job whenever your component changes or something new happens. By default, it wants to do its job every time your component shows something new. But, that might be too much for us.

So, to make it a bit more chill, we use the dependency array. It's like a list of things that the "useEffect" friend should pay attention to. When something in that list changes, it's a signal for your friend to jump into action and do its job.

Now, what goes into this list? Well, they are like the special ingredients your friend needs to work correctly. These special things are your "state variables" and "props" that you use inside the "useEffect." If you forget to tell your friend about them, it might not notice when they change, and that could lead to some bugs.

Let's look at an example: If your friend uses a "title" or "user rating," you gotta put them in the list. It's like saying, "Hey, if these change, let my friend know, so it can do its thing properly."

Think of "useEffect" as a listener at a party. It's there, just hanging out, but when someone in its list (the dependency array) changes, it starts dancing (executes the effect)!

And why is this cool? Because it helps keep your component in sync with the outside world. For example, if your component is showing the title of a page, and that title changes, "useEffect" notices and updates your component. It's like magic!

But, here's the trick: If you don't set up this list (dependency array) properly, your friend might not dance (execute) when it should. And we don't want that â€“ we want our friend to be a great dancer at the right times!

So, in a nutshell, "useEffect" and its dependency array are like a dynamic duo, making sure your React components stay in sync with what's happening around them. It's a bit like a dance where your components follow the rhythm of the changing state and props. And that's the secret sauce to making cool and responsive web applications with React!

I hope this makes the "useEffect" and its dependency array a bit clearer for you! Feel free to ask if you have more questions.

So, I have mentioned the use effect dependency array a few times already, but we don't know yet what it actually does and how it works. So, let's change that in this lecture.

As we saw at the beginning of this section, by default in effect will run after each and every render. However, that's almost never what we want. But, the good news is that we can change this default behavior by passing a dependency array into the useEffect hook as a second argument.

But why does use effect actually need an array of dependencies, you might ask? Well, the reason is that without this array, React doesn't know when to actually run the effect. But, if we do specify the effect dependencies by passing in the dependency array, the effect will be executed each time that one of the dependencies changes.

And, we will come back to why this is so amazing in the next slide. But, for now, this is all you need to know.

Now, what exactly are those dependencies? Well, effect dependencies are state variables and props that are used inside the effect. And, the rule is that each and every one of those state variables and props must be included in the dependency array.

But, let's take a look at an example to understand what I'm talking about. And, the code here is really not important. What matters is that the effect uses the title prop and the user rating state. We can clearly see at the top of the code that title is indeed a prop and that user rating is indeed a prop of state. Therefore, both of them must be included in the dependency array.

So, the effect function depends on these variables to do its work, and therefore we need to tell React about them. Otherwise, if the title or the user rating changes, React will not know about this change, and, therefore, it won't be able to re-execute the effect code. And, this will then lead to a bug called stale closure. And, we will talk about what a stale closure is and also about some more rules for the dependency array in a later more advanced section.

But, for now, let's actually understand why the dependency array is so important for the useEffect hook.

So, I like to think of the useEffect hook as an event listener that is listening for one or more dependencies to change. And, when one of the dependencies does change, useEffect will simply execute the effect again. So, a bit like a regular event listener, but for effects.

But, let's go back to our previous example where we had the title and user rating dependencies in the array. So, whenever the title or the user rating changes, React will execute the effect again. So, it will run the code one more time, which will in turn update the document title. So, the website title that we see in a browser tab.

So, essentially, effects react to updates to state and props that are used inside the effect because, again, those are the effects' dependencies. So, in a way, effects are reactive, just like React reacts to state updates by re-rendering the UI. And, this is extremely useful and powerful, as we will see throughout the rest of the course.

But, all this only works if we correctly specify the dependency array.

Okay, but now let's remember how I said in the very first lecture about effects, that effects are used to keep a component synchronized with some external system. So, some system that lives outside of our React-based code.

And, if we think about it, that's exactly what is happening here. So, the state and props of our component are now in fact synchronized with an external system, which is, in this case, the title of the document. Now, updating the title in some other way will, of course, not magically update the title or user rating. So, the synchronization only works in one way, but that's not really the point.

The same actually happens with state updates, and we still say that the UI is in sync with state. So, the point is that useEffect truly is a synchronization mechanism, so a mechanism to synchronize effects with the state of the application. And, you will discover this each time that you're going to use an effect. So, let's go explore this a little bit further.

So, as we just learned, whenever a dependency changes, the effect is executed again. But, now, let's remember that dependencies are always state or props. And, what happens to a component each time that its state or props are updated? Well, that's right. The component will re-render. This means that effects and the lifecycle of a component instance are deeply interconnected. That's why when the useEffect hook was first introduced, many people thought that it was a lifecycle hook rather than a hook for synchronizing the component with a side effect.

Now, the conclusion and the big takeaway from this is that we can use the dependency array in order to run effects whenever the component renders or re-renders. So, in a way, the useEffect hook is actually about synchronization and about
