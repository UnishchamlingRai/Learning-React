**Introduction to Advanced React Patterns**

This part of our learning is all about some cool tricks that experienced React developers use to make their code more flexible and reusable. Imagine you're building with LEGO, and you want your creations to fit together easily and be adaptable to different situations. That's what these patterns help us achieve in React.

**Types of Code Reusability in React**

In React, there are mainly two types of code we want to reuse: stuff that looks a certain way on the screen (UI) and stuff that helps manage how our app behaves (stateful logic).

**1. Reusing UI: Components and Props**

Think of UI like the different parts of a car. We use components as building blocks for our user interface. Props are like the customizable features of those components. They allow us to change how a component looks or behaves without rewriting the whole thing.

We can even put other components or content inside components using a special prop called "children." This makes our components even more flexible.

**2. Reusing Stateful Logic: Custom Hooks**

Now, imagine the engine and gears of our car. Stateful logic is what helps our app remember things or respond to user actions. We can reuse this logic by creating custom hooks. These hooks are like ready-made tools that we can use and share across different parts of our app.

**Advanced Patterns for Reusability**

But what if we want to reuse both the way something looks and how it behaves? That's where advanced patterns come in.

**1. Render Props Pattern**

This is like having a magic wand that lets us customize how a component looks and behaves. With render props, we pass a special function to a component, and it tells the component what to show on the screen. It's super flexible and lets us reuse complex UI and logic together.

**2. Compound Component Pattern**

Imagine a big, fancy machine made up of smaller, specialized parts. That's what the compound component pattern is like. We have multiple components that work together to create something bigger. Each part manages its own stuff without bothering the others, making our code neat and organized.

**Why These Patterns Matter**

Knowing how to use these patterns sets us apart as React developers. They make our code more modular, easier to understand, and faster to build.

So let's dive in and see how these patterns work in action!

Hope this breakdown helps clarify the concepts!


//SUBTITLE
This section

is all about advanced React patterns

that are used by senior React engineers

to make components even more reusable and flexible.

So since this part is about reusability,

and since we already talked a lot

about reusability before,

let's now get a quick overview

of how we can reuse different types of code in React,

and how these advanced patterns

that we're gonna talk about fit into the picture.

So in React,

we basically might want to reuse two big types of code.

So we can either reuse pieces of UI,

or we can reuse some stateful logic,

so logic that contains at least one React hook,

no matter which one.

Now, there's also a third category, which is simply

for reusing some non-stateful logic,

but for that, we can simply use normal JavaScript functions.

But for React,

what matters is how we reuse UI and stateful logic.

So as we already know, to reuse pieces of the UI,

we use components and props.

And the idea is that we use props basically as an API

for the component, so as a way of interacting

with the component from the outside

so that we can customize how it works

and what it looks like.

Now, taking this idea one step further,

we can even pass in content

or other components into components,

simply by using the slightly more advanced,

but extremely useful children prop.

So basically, in order to customize not only

what a component looks like, but also the content itself.

And we already did this many times before,

but I just want to summarize everything here.

Now, moving on to reusing stateful logic.

We already know that we can do so simply

by writing our own custom hooks.

So again, custom hooks allow us

to write our own React hooks,

which are composed of any number of any other hooks.

Okay, but what if we need to reuse visuals

and stateful logic at the same time

in some more advanced ways?

Well, that's where more advanced patterns come into play.

So one of these advanced patterns

that developers came up with

is the so-called render props pattern.

And I say pattern because these are not things

that are baked into React, so they are not React features.

Instead, they are simply clever ways of using React

that have emerged over time

in order to solve certain problems.

But anyway, with render props,

the user of a component has complete control

over what the component actually renders

by passing in a function as a prop.

So this function basically tells the component

what and how to render.

And the beauty of this is that with this pattern,

we can reuse logic that has some UI,

so some JSX attached to it,

while giving the component the ability

to receive even more JSX.

And I know that this sounds a bit like the same thing

as the children prop, but this is quite different actually.

But don't worry about that at this point

because this, again, is just an overview.

You'll understand this really well in a future lecture

when we see the render prop pattern in action.

Now, this pattern was actually super common in the old days

before React hooks, because it was basically the only way

of sharing stateful logic across different components.

But today for that, we already have custom hooks,

and so now, this pattern isn't as common as it was before.

However, it's still very useful and very important

for certain situations

in which we really do want to reuse some logic

that has some UI attached to it,

as we will see in the next few lectures.

Now okay.

And now for the second advanced pattern

that we will talk about,

we have the compound component pattern.

And compound means, in this context,

that we will have multiple components that play together

in order to create one big, let's call it super component,

which is then the compound component.

And this pattern allows us

to build extremely self-contained components

that need to

or that want to manage their own state internally,

so without that state being necessary

inside the parent component

that uses the compound component.

And again, this will make more sense

when we see it in action.

Now, there are even more patterns than these two,

but if you know how to use, and when to use these two,

that will already set you apart

from most of the other React developers out there.

And so now, let's learn all about them in practice.
