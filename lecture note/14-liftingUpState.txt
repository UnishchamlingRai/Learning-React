##what is Lifting State Up
Lifting State Up in React refers to the practice of moving the state of a component upwards to a common ancestor, typically a parent component, that needs to share that state with its child components. This pattern is used when two or more components in a React application need access to the same piece of state.

In simpler terms:

Components are like Rooms:

Imagine different parts of your React app as rooms.
State is like Information or Stuff:

Think of state as information or stuff that a room wants to know or share.
Lifting State Up is like Sharing a Common Space:

Instead of keeping that information separately in each room (component), you move it to a common space, like a shared living room (a parent component).
Accessibility:

Now, all rooms (child components) can easily access and use that shared information from the living room (parent component).
Example:
Suppose you have a temperature converter app with Celsius and Fahrenheit components. Instead of each component managing its own temperature value, you can lift the temperature state up to a common parent component. This way, both Celsius and Fahrenheit components can access and update the shared temperature value.

In essence, Lifting State Up promotes better data flow, organization, and avoids duplication of state. It's a way of creating a shared space for information that multiple components need to interact with in your React application.
