//GHAT GPT EXPLAINATION
Certainly! Let's break down the explanation in easy-to-understand terms:

---

Imagine you're building a web application, and you have different parts of the application that need to share information, like the user's details or a list of products. Redux is like a tool that helps you manage and share this information among different pieces of your web app.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Redux is a Helper:** It's like having a helper (Redux) that keeps track of important information for your entire web app.
  
2. **Global State:** This helper manages something called the "global state," which is like a storage room where your app stores important information that multiple parts of the app can use.

3. **Actions:** To update this global state, you use "actions," which are like instructions you give to the helper. For example, you might tell it to update the user's information or the list of products.

4. **Reducers:** The helper has different workers called "reducers." Each reducer is responsible for a specific type of information, like one worker for users and another for products. These workers know how to follow the instructions (actions) and update their specific part of the storage room.

**How it Works:**
1. **Create an Action:** When you want to change something (e.g., update the user's details), you create an action. It's like writing a note with clear instructions, such as "Update User" and what the new information is.

2. **Tell the Helper (Dispatch):** You give this note to the helper by dispatching the action. It's like telling the helper, "Hey, we want to update the user's details. Here's how."

3. **Reducers Get to Work:** The helper knows which worker (reducer) is responsible for the user's details, so it gives the note to that worker. The worker looks at the note, does some calculations, and updates the user's information.

4. **Combine Information:** The helper collects the updated information from all the workers (reducers) and combines it into one big storage room (global state).

5. **Re-Render:** Whenever this storage room is updated, any part of your web app that uses this information gets notified and updates itself. It's like when you change something in one corner of the room, and everything that depends on that information adjusts accordingly.

**Why Redux?**
- **History:** In the past, Redux was used a lot, like a must-have tool for web apps. Many developers learned it because it was widely used.

- **Teamwork:** If you work in a team, you might encounter older code that uses Redux. So, it's good to understand how it works.

- **Complex Apps:** For big and complex apps with lots of information that needs frequent updates, Redux can be handy.

**Conclusion:**
- Today, there are other tools, and not all apps need Redux. But learning it is valuable because it helps you understand how to manage information in a web app effectively.

In the next part, we'll dive into writing some actual code for Redux.



//SUBTITLE
As always, let's start by getting

a good understanding of what Redux actually is

and how the mechanics of Redux work

especially when compared with the useReducer hook.

So in a nutshell, Redux is a third-party library

that we can use to manage global state in a web application.

And I say web application,

because Redux is actually a complete standalone library

that we could use with any framework

or even Vanilla JavaScript.

However, Redux has always been tightly linked to React

and they are actually quite easy to connect

using the react-redux library as we will do

throughout this section.

Now, the big idea behind Redux is that

all the global state in your application can be stored

inside this one globally accessible store

which we can then update using actions.

And if this sounds familiar,

it's because the useReducer hook

implements a very similar pattern.

So updating state by dispatching actions.

Remember and in fact, the mechanism behind Redux

and useReducer is so similar

that I will assume that you know how to use useReducer

and build the teaching of Redux onto the knowledge

that you already have.

So again, you should have a pretty good understanding

of the useReducer hook in order to move on in this section.

And if you don't

then please go back to that useReducer section first.

But anyway, the idea of updating state

in React and in Redux is always the same.

So in the case of Redux, as soon as we update the store

all the React components that consume some data

from the store will be re-rendered.

So conceptually, if we think about this

Redux is actually quite similar

to combining the Context API with the useReducer hook

as we have done in the World Wise app.

And in fact, many developers even say

that the Context API is a replacement for Redux.

However, the truth is a bit more nuanced than that

as we will discuss by the end of the section

once you have some experience with both of these tools.

Now Redux has a long history

and so today, there are basically two versions of Redux.

So two different ways of writing Redux applications,

but which are totally compatible with each other.

So we have the classic Redux and we have the more modern way

of writing Redux with Redux Toolkit.

And as you would expect, we will learn both of them

in this section starting with classic Redux

so that you get the right foundations.

Okay, now before we move on to learn how Redux works

let's quickly check out when we should actually use Redux.

And let's start with some history.

So historically, a few years back

Redux was used in almost every React app out there

for all global state management needs.

So you really needed to know Redux.

It was as if Redux was even part of React.

Today, however the landscape has changed tremendously,

because there are now many alternatives

as we have already talked about

in the advanced state management lecture

in a previous section.

So today, many apps don't actually need Redux anymore

and also don't use Redux anymore.

And this means

that you might not even need to learn Redux right now.

So why is it included in this course then?

Well, for three big reasons.

First, since Redux has a reputation

for being very hard to learn

this was probably the most requested topic

for this course by my current students.

And I think that this course does teach it pretty well

in an easy to understand way.

Second, when you're working on a team

you will likely work with an older code base

and then you will definitely encounter Redux.

Therefore, you need to learn how it works

even if you don't master it.

And third, some applications do actually require

something like Redux.

And so, let's take a look at when that is

by bringing back this overview from a previous lecture.

So my recommendation

and the recommendation of many experts

is to use a global state management library like Redux,

only when you have lots of global UI state

that you need to update frequently.

And remember that UI state basically means state

that is not fetched from a server

that would be remote state.

So UI state is simply data about the UI itself

or data that doesn't need to be communicated

to an API or so.

And this distinction is really important,

because remember for global remote state

we have many better options nowadays like React Query,

SWR, or even a tool that is kind of included

in modern Redux Toolkit, which is Redux Toolkit Query.

So again, do you need to manage a lot

of non-remote state in your app,

then Redux might be perfect for that.

But the truth is that most global state is actually remote

which is the reason why so many apps

don't use Redux anymore.

But we are actually here to learn Redux

at least if you still think that it's worthwhile.

And I personally think that it is.

And so, let's now quickly look at the mechanics

of how Redux works.

So as I said in the very beginning,

this won't be too hard for you,

because you already know how useReducer works.

And so, let's just quickly review that.

So with useReducer when we want to update state

from an event handler in a component

we start by creating an action.

This action is simply an object that usually contains

a type and a payload,

which is information about how the state should be updated.

We then dispatch that action

to a so-called reducer function.

The reducer takes the action type and the payload,

and together with the current state

calculates the next state, so the new state value.

And to finish as the state updates,

all the components that use that state are re-rendered.

And so, this is really the core mechanism

behind useReducer.

Now Redux works very similarly to this.

The big difference is that we no longer have one reducer

for one component as with useReducer

but we have one reducer for the entire application.

So that one global store that I talked about in the beginning

and that store is then used by all the components

that need access to this global state.

Now, of course, it's not just one reducer

but rather you will typically have many small reducer functions

that handle different parts of the state.

So you could have a reducer for the user,

for the products, for the shopping cart, etc.

So these small reducer functions then compose

the big root reducer that is used by the store.

And this root reducer is responsible for combining

all the states returned by the small reducers

into the one big state object

that makes up the global state.

So when we want to update the state in Redux

we start by creating an action just like with useReducer.

This action is then dispatched to the root reducer,

and the root reducer dispatches the action

to the relevant small reducer function

which then calculates the next state

and returns that state to the root reducer.

So in the end, the root reducer

combines all the states returned by the small reducers

into the one big state object.

And as soon as this state object updates,

all the components that use that state are re-rendered.

And so, this is how Redux works on a high level.

But before we dive into code,

let's actually visualize this a bit more.

So let's consider this very simple application here.

It has a state object that contains

a user and a list of products.

And we have two components in this application.

One component displays information about the user

and the other component displays a list of products.

So when we want to update the user in Redux,

we start by creating an action.

This action has a type, which is "UPDATE_USER"

and a payload, which is the new user data.

We then dispatch this action to the root reducer.

And the root reducer knows that the user state

is handled by the user reducer.

So it dispatches the "UPDATE_USER" action

to the user reducer along with the current user state

and the payload from the action.

The user reducer then calculates the next user state

based on the action type and the payload

and returns this new user state to the root reducer.

Now, let's say we also want to update the list of products.

So we create another action with the type "UPDATE_PRODUCTS"

and the payload, which is the new list of products.

We dispatch this action to the root reducer

which knows that the products state

is handled by the products reducer.

So it dispatches the "UPDATE_PRODUCTS" action

to the products reducer along with the current products state

and the payload from the action.

The products reducer then calculates the next products state

based on the action type and the payload

and returns this new products state to the root reducer.

Now, the root reducer has received the updated user state

and the updated products state

from the user reducer and the products reducer.

It then combines these states into the one big state object

and returns this updated state object.

And as soon as this state object updates,

all the components that use that state are re-rendered.

So this is the flow of updating the state in Redux.

And this visualization really emphasizes

how actions and reducers work together

to update the global state in a predictable way.

Now that we have a good conceptual understanding

of how Redux works, let's move on to the next video

where we will start writing some Redux code

and set up a Redux store
