GHATGPT EXPLANATION
Sure, let's break it down in simpler terms:

**Introduction:**
We're going to talk about making React apps work faster. There are three main things we'll focus on: 

1. Stop unnecessary updates (wasted renders).
2. Make the app respond quickly.
3. Reduce the app's size.

**Preventing Wasted Renders:**
- When we talk about preventing wasted renders, we mean avoiding unnecessary work that doesn't change anything on the screen.
- We can use tools like memo, useMemo, and useCallback to remember things, so we don't redo them unless needed.
- We can also use a technique to avoid redoing work when things don't really change on the screen.

**Improving App Speed:**
- To make the app feel fast, we use tools like useMemo and useCallback again, and a modern useTransition tool.
- These tools help in managing how the app shows updates to the user.

**Reducing Bundle Size:**
- For a smaller app, we use fewer extra tools and load only what's needed when it's needed. This helps the app load faster.

**No Need to Always Use Everything:**
- We don't have to use all these tools all the time, just when it makes sense. It's like having tools in a toolbox and using the right one for the job.

**Understanding When Things Update:**
- We learn that in React, things update (or re-render) when the state changes, when something in the background changes, or when a parent part of the app changes.

**Props and Misconceptions:**
- We clarify a common misunderstanding about props (information passed between parts of the app). Props don't directly make things update; it's usually the parent part of the app changing that causes updates.

**Wasted Renders Explained:**
- Sometimes, even if nothing visible changes on the screen, the app might be doing extra work (wasted renders). This can make the app feel slow and unresponsive.

**Why Wasted Renders Matter:**
- Wasted renders can be a problem when they happen too often or when the app is slow. It can make the app feel laggy, especially after a user does something.

**Conclusion:**
- We want to avoid situations where the app does unnecessary work. In the next few videos, we'll learn how to handle this and make our React apps work more efficiently.

Certainly! Here's the text with the timestamp numbers removed:

We're gonna start this section by getting a quick overview of what can actually be optimized in React applications and how we can do it.

So, there are three main areas that we can focus on when we need to optimize performance of React apps.

First, we can try to prevent wasted renders. Second, we can improve the overall app speed and responsiveness to make sure that the app is 100% fluid and without delays. And third, we can reduce the bundle size.

So, let's quickly look at some built-in React tools for each of these areas.

So in order to prevent wasted renders, we can memorize components with memo or we can memorize objects and functions with useMemo and useCallback hooks. And of course, you don't know what any of this means at this point, but we'll get to it over the next few lectures.

We can also use a technique where we pass elements into other elements as children or as a normal prop in order to prevent them from being re-rendered.

Now to improve the perceived up speed, we can again use the useMemo and useCallback hooks and we can also use the modern useTransition hook net. Again, more about these later.

Finally, we can reduce the bundle size simply by using fewer third-party packages in our code base and we can also implement code splitting and lazy loading.

Now there is no need to use all these tools and techniques all the time. So, the main goal of this section is to basically just give you access to these tools so that you can have them in your toolbox whenever a situation calls for one of them.

And throughout this section, you will learn exactly when that is. So in which situations you need each of these tools.

Also, keep in mind that this list of tools and techniques is by no means exhaustive. So there are many other optimization best practices that I already told you about before and that you are already using, for example, not defining components inside other components. And so I didn't include all of these in this list. So, these are mainly tools that we will talk about in this or in future sections.

Now the first part of this section is gonna be about optimizing wasted renders. However, to understand what wasted renders actually are, we first need to review when exactly a component instance gets re-rendered.

So, this will serve as a nice reminder of how rendering works in practice.

So in React, a component instance only gets re-rendered in three different situations. First, when the component state changes. Second, a component instance gets re-rendered whenever there's a change in a context that the component is subscribed to. And this is exactly what we've learned in the previous section.

And finally, as we learned in the section on how React works behind the scenes, whenever a component re-renders, all its child components will automatically be re-rendered as well. And so the third reason for a component to re-render is a parent component re-rendering.

But now, you might be wondering what about prop changes? Doesn't updating props also re-render a component?

Well, actually, that's technically not the case. So, that's a common misconception. And actually even I told you this at the beginning of the course, but it was only because you didn't know yet how rendering works. Because it is true that it does look as if components re-render when their props change.

But what actually happens is that props only change when the parent re-renders but when the parent re-renders, the children who receive the prop will re-render anyway. And so, the real reason why a component re-renders when props change is that the parent has re-rendered.

Okay.

But anyway, it's important to also remember that rendering a component does not mean that the DOM actually gets updated, right? So all that rendering means is that the component function gets called and that React will create a new virtual DOM and do all the diffing and reconciliation that we have already talked about before.

And this can be an expensive and wasteful operation which brings us to an important topic of this video, wasted renders.

So, a wasted render is basically a render that didn't produce any change in the DOM. So, it's a waste because all the different calculations still had to be done but it didn't result in any new DOM. And so therefore, all the calculations were for nothing.

Now, most of the time, this is actually no problem at all because React is very fast. However, it can become a problem when re-renders happen way too frequently or when the component is very slow in rendering. And so, this can then make the application feel laggy and unresponsive.

For example, not updating the UI fast enough after the user performs a certain action.

So, we want to avoid situations like that at all costs.

So, that's basically what we're gonna be dealing with in the next couple of videos.
