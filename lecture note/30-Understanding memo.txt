CHATGPT EXPLANATION
Sure, let's break it down:

Imagine you're building something with a tool called React. In React, there are three helpful things you can use to make your work better. These are like tools in a toolbox.

The first concept is called "memoization." It's not "memorization," but "memoization." It's like a trick to make your work faster. Imagine you have a task to do, and you've done it before. Instead of doing it all over again, you remember what you did last time and use that information. In computer terms, it's like storing the results of a task and reusing them if you need to do the same task again. It's a way to save time.

Now, in React, we have tools like the "memo" function, "useMemo" hook, and "useCallback" hook. These tools help us use the memoization trick to make our React applications work faster.

The "memo" function, for example, helps us make parts of our project (components) remember things. Imagine you have a small part of your project, and you don't want it to redo its job every time something else changes. You want it to remember its work if nothing important has changed. This is where the "memo" function comes in handy. It helps us tell React to only redo a job if it really needs to.

But remember, using these tools is like using a special power. You don't use it everywhere; you use it only when it makes sense. If your project is not too big or things don't change a lot, you might not need to use these tools. They're like a superhero suit â€“ you wear it when the situation requires it.

So, in simple terms, memoization is like a trick to remember things and use them again to save time, and React gives us tools like "memo" to use this trick in our projects when it's necessary.

Sure, let's summarize the spoken content without the timestamps:

Over the next few lectures, we're going to add three more React tools to your toolbox: the memo function, the useMemo hook, and the useCallback hook.

The fundamental concept behind these three tools is memoization. Memoization is an optimization technique that executes a pure function one time and stores the results in memory (a cache). If the same function is called again with the same inputs, it returns the cached results without executing the function again.

In React, we can use memoization to optimize our applications. The memo function helps memoize components, while the useMemo and useCallback hooks are used to memoize objects and functions. Memoization helps prevent wasted renders and improves overall application speed.

In this lecture, the focus is on how to memoize components using the memo function. React's memo function creates a component that will not re-render when its parent re-renders, as long as the past props stay the same between renders. This is achieved by memoizing the component based on the principle of memoization explained earlier.

It's important to note that memoizing a component primarily affects props. Memoized components will still re-render if their own state changes or if there is a change in a context that the component is subscribed to.

However, memoization is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Memo is most useful for heavy components that render frequently with the same props. If the props are usually different between re-renders or the component only re-renders occasionally and is fast, using memo may not bring significant benefits. Memoization is a tool to be used selectively based on the specific needs of your application.
