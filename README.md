Learning React is very exciting. While learning React, I made some projects:

1. **Pizza Menu**: Through this project, I learned about components, how to make them reusable, and how to use them properly. I also learned about props and JSX.

2. **Travel List**: This project helped me understand how to use the useState hook for state management and how state updates cause rerenders in React. It also taught me when to use useState for local state and when to use global state management tools like Redux or the Context API.

3. **Eat-n-split**: By working on this project, I leveraged my previous knowledge of React, including state management, components, JSX, and props.

4. **usePopcorn**: I learned about useEffect, data fetching, and custom hooks while building this project.

5. **Classy Weather**: This project introduced me to class components in React, which are less commonly used now but are important to understand for legacy codebases.

6. **Quiz App**: Through this project, I explored the useReducer hook, which is used for advanced state management. It serves as an alternative to useState and simplifies state management for larger projects.

7. **WorldWise**: Building this project, I learned about React Router for routing, the Context API for global state management, and performance optimization techniques like memo, useMemo, and useCallback.

8. **Fast React Pizza**: In this project, I applied React Router for data loading, Redux, Redux Toolkit, thunks, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

9. **The Wild Oasis**: This is a comprehensive project where I used React Query for remote state management, Styled Components for styling, React Hook Form for form management and validation, Supabase for backend services, and Recharts library for creating beautiful charts. Additionally, I learned about advanced compound component patterns, authentication, dark mode, and professional application planning and development techniques.

These projects have helped me gain a deep understanding of React and its ecosystem while honing my skills in frontend development.
